				<P>First, put the image in the repository (folder) of your project.

				<p>It's important to distguish between putting an image on the webpage and putting an image into the code of the program. If you just want a static, non moving picture, it's probably easier to put the image in the html code of th webpage. To put the image on the webpage, I use something like this image html tag <code>&lt;img src="http://aAHK0LA.png"&gt</code> in the body of the index.html. 
				<p>Here's an example of a non moving picture on the webpage.
				<p><img src="images/aAHK0LA.png">
				<p>If you want to animate the picture or have interact with other objects in the program, you'll probably want to put it in the .pde code file. Here's an example of an animated picture in a processing program
				<canvas id="ImageHowTo" data-processing-sources="ImageHowTo.pde" width="450" height="350">
				</canvas>
				
				
				
				<p>To put the image in a processing program. I need to declare a <code>PImage</code> variable, initialize it with <code>loadImage()</code>and draw it to the screen with the <code>image()</code> function. Here's a simple program that displays a picture:
				<p><code><pre>
PImage b; //Declare a PImage named b
void setup()
{
	size(450,315);
	b = loadImage("http://8s8eke8.jpg"); //loads the image
}
void draw()
{
	image(b, 0, 0,450,315); //displays the image with top left corner at (0,0) width of 450 and height of 315
}
				</pre></code>
