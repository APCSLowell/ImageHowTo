				<P>First, it's important to distguish between putting an image on the webpage and putting an image into the code of the program. If you just want a static, non moving picture, it's probably easier to put the image in the html code of th webpage. If you want to animate the picture or have interact with other objects in the program, you'll probably want to put it in the .pde code file.</P>
				<p>Here's an example of a non moving picture on the webpage.
				<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/aAHK0LA.png">
				<p>And here's an example of an animated picture in a processing program

				<p>Git Hub doesn't let you store large files like images or music. If you want to put images into your program or website, you'll first need a image hosting services. I'm going to use imgur.com. First, upload your images to imgur by clicking on "Computer", selecting the images and clicking start upload.

				<p>Once your images are online, you use the "Direct Link (email & IM)" to place the picture
				on either your webpage or in the program

				<p>To put the image on the webpage, I use something like this image html tag <code>&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/aAHK0LA.png"&gt</code> in the body of the index.html. You can copy and paste from the box labeled "HTML Image (websites / blogs)" on imgur.
				
				<p>To put the image in a processing program. I need to declare a <code>PImage</code> variable, initialize it and draw it to the screen with the <code>image()</code> function. Here's a simple program that loads a mug shot of Bill Gates.
				<p><code><pre>
PImage b; //Declare a PImage named b
void setup()
{
	size(450,315);
	b = loadImage("http://imgur.com/8s8eke8.jpg"); //initialize with imgur url
}
void draw()
{
	image(b, 0, 0,450,315); //image has top left corner at (0,0) width of 450 and height of 315
}
				</pre></code>
